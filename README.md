# Data Analytics Mini Projects
These are some mini-projects completed under the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.

## Project 1: Web Scraping and Data Wrangling - Analyzing Historical Stock-Revenue Data

In this mini-project, I explored Tesla and Gamestop stocks. I used the Python yfinance library and BeautifulSoup to extract stock data and implement web scraping. Then, I performed data wrangling to standardize the format of the currency data and dealing with missing data. Finally, I plotted the stock graphs. 

## Project 2: SQL - Analyzing Chicago Socio-economic Data

In this mini-project, I looked at three datasets about Chicago: socio-economic indicators, public school performance data, and crime data since 2001. I used sqlite3 to write SQL queries in Python to analyze the three datasets and explore their relationships to reveal insights about socio-economic status, education, and crime in different communities in Chicago. 

## Project 3: Regression Model - House Sales in King County, Seattle

In this mini-project, I analyzed house sales in King County, Seattle, in Washington State. I did some data wrangling to drop irrelevant columns and replace missing data with averages, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in houses sold. Then, I did some exploratory data analysis by creating boxplots and dot plots to explore simple relationships such as determining whether houses with a waterfront view or without a waterfront view have more price outliers and the correlation between square footage and house price. Finally, I used regression analysis to predict house prices based on square footage. I fit a linear regression model using certain features, trained the model, tested it, evaluated it, and refined it accordingly. 

## Project 4: Data Visualization - Historical Automobile Sales 

In this mini-project, I explored the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods from 1980 to mid-2020. I analyzed the data by creating elaborate visualizations to answer questions such as, “Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession versus non-recession periods?” and “How did the GDP vary over time during recession and non-recession periods?” I explored the seasonality impact of automobile sales, the correlation between average vehicle price and the sales volume during recessions, the impact of recessions on advertising expenditures for various vehicle types, and the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the recession periods.
